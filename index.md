Hello and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Maise, but you may see me using Mai online. I am currently based in Lisbon, Portugal.

Although, I am just starting out professionaly as a front-end developer, I have been interested in tech for many years. My earliest memory of using anything tech related, was an children's laptop that I received as a gift on Christmas day many years ago. This laptop could only do 2 things: allow me to type in words and read them out loud to me. But to me it was so fascinating that I was so careful with it and after all these years, I still have it. And somehow it still works!
This little laptop was like an rare item to me because it was the first time I used a computer that could reproduce human language. 
Looking back, this object might be the catalyst of two of my main interests. 

Throughout the years I developed one big interest that started out as an hobby. As a child, I used to watch Cartoon Network everyday after school, but at the time I did not speak english and the shows weren't voiced over or subtitled. So, I developed a game where I would learn how to write a word, based on it's pronounciation, and I would go look it up it's meaning on my English-Portuguese dictionary. This way, I taugth myself english.

This silly hobby of mine lead me to studying languages in higher education. During my college years, I was convinced that I would go there, follow my plan and graduate, with no detours.
During my second semester, I randomly signed up for a linguistics class because I wanted some easy credits. 
Among the many things that were said by the professor, the thing grabbed my attention was the fact that in linguistics, technology could be paired with language. This discovery made me sign up for classes like Psycholinguistics, Computacional linguistics and Translation for media.

Although my translation for media class did use software (Trados), it was a tool that needs to be fed information before it was truly useful.
During my Computacional linguistics class, I learned some Python basics and it blew my mind! Besides my courseload, I started looking for self paced courses to learn more about programming. So, in 2021 I decided to teach myself how to code.

My self paced journey was not what I expected, as I took a lot of breaks and felt very unmotivated to complete the course that I was taking. But I was determined to learn, so I enrolled in a fullstack coding bootcamp. I chose this route because I thought having a curriculum that was designed to help people start from 0 was much more useful to me than trying to figure out a roadmap on my own. This was the point when I realized I preferred front-end to back-end. 

After completing my bootcamp, I did not try to break in tech because at the time I was working in a corporate setting and I felt reluctant to leave the safety of that environment. 

And that brings us to now. I decided that 2023 will be the year that I will transition into this industry.
Currently, I am still studying on my own pace while I'm looking to get my first role in the tech industry.
